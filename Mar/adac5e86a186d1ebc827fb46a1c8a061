Kenya Airways which is planning to cancel all international flights by Wednesday said employees will have to do with pay cuts of between 25 per cent and 50 per cent, depending on their level, with low cadre employees being handed a slight reprieve and taking the lower cuts while the middle-level staff gets the 50 per cent cut. Staff will also be required to take unpaid days off work.

Ivestec Securities projects that Co-op Bank shares are likely to have a fair price of Sh17.30 from the current Sh15.15, Kenya Commercial Bank comes second with a 12.9 per cent upside potential from Sh52.00 to Sh58.70 while Equity comes third with a projected rise of 3.9 per cent from Sh50.25 to Sh52.20. 
With this projection, Investec Securities indicate that Co-op Bank is on track to deliver a 12-month return of 22.3 per cent in Kenya shilling and a return of 16.0 per cent in US dollars.     Kenya Commercial Bank comes second with a 22.2 per cent Kenya shillings return and a return of 15.9 per cent in US dollars in 12 months, while Equity is third with 10.1 and 5.4 per cent returns in Kenya Shillings and US dollars, respectively. 
Investec Securities has thus rated the three stocks, with Co-operative Bank retaining a BUY rating, KCB upgraded from HOLD to a BUY while Equity has been rated a HOLD. Co-operative Bank deliveres a much stronger growth in non-funded income streams relative to other banks, this can be attributed to robust digital banking and agent banking channels, a trend expected to continue in the next 12 months.     “We forecast rising Return on Equity as existing clients are migrated to cheaper digital and agent channels which should contain cost,” says the Investec Report, adding “Overall, we expect Cooperative Bank to continue to benefit from strong NIR generation driving revenue growth as costs are contained below inflation. We believe Cooperative Bank will continue to deliver positive JAWS to FY21 as existing clients are migrated to cheaper digital and agent channels containing year-on-year growth in costs, while improved transaction volumes should drive sustained NIR growth.”
Kenyan banks continue to offer more competitive returns relative to their counterparts in Nigeria which is as a result of Kenya’s superior banking policy consistency and stability as compared to Nigeria. Especially the recent repeal of rate caps in Kenya.     “The current policy dynamic in Kenya, on balance, remains supportive of real earnings growth in the medium term. Following the repeal of the interest rate cap, we have increased our target prices by an estimated 27 per cent, on average, across our coverage banks,” says the Investec Report.

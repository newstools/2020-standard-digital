Last Journey  There is a train at the station
With a seat reserved just for me
I'm excited about its destination
As I’ve heard it sets you free

The trials and tribulations
The pain and stress we breathe
Don't exist were I am going
Only happiness I believe

I hope that you will be there
To wish me on my way
It's not a journey you can join in
It’s not your time today

There'll be many destinations
Some are happy, some are sad
Each one a brief reminder
Of the great times that we've had

Many friends I know are waiting
Who took an earlier train
To greet and reassure me
That nothing has really changed

We’ll take the time together
To catch up on the past
To build a new beginning
One that will always last

One day you'll take your journey
On the train just like me
And i promise that I'll be there
At the station and you will see

That Life is just a journey
Enriched by those you meet
No one can take that from you
It's always yours to keep'

But now as no seat is vacant
You will have to muddle through
Make sure you fulfil your ambitions
As you know i’ll be watching you

And if there’s an occasion
To mention who you knew
Speak kindly of that person
As one day it will be you

Now i can’t except this ending
And as it's time for me to leave
Please make haste to the reception
To enjoy my drinks, they're free! There is a train at the station

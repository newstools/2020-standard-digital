DPP okays murder charges against nine police officers after IPOA probe             Japheth Ogila  23rd Apr 2020 18:09:12 GMT +0300 Japheth Ogila  23rd Apr 2020 18:09:12 GMT +0300 Japheth Ogila   The Director of Public Prosecutions has preferred murder charges against nine police officers in three separate incidents after a probe by the Independent Police Oversight Authority (IPOA). In the first case, a police inspector, a corporal and four police constables have been accused of killing Mary Chepkorir Kiprotich in March 2020 at her home in Laikipia County. The accused persons are Harrison Mwa (inspector), John Kimweli Musau, Linus Kipngetich Terer, Joseph Mureithi, David Kipkemoi and Magdalene Nachapai. A statement by IPOA reveals that the suspects stormed Ms Kipkorir’s home during an operation targeting the sale of illegal brews after which they assaulted and killed her. “The officers attached to Majiwa General Service Unit (GSU) camp had accompanied the area Chief in conducting an operation against the sale of illegal alcohol, during which she died,” IPOA reveals. In the second case, Mlolongo Police Station Chief Inspector Stephen Lelei and Sergeant Fredrick Leliman are accused of killing Jacob Mbai and Elizabeth Nduku in Mlolongo town, Machakos County. IPOA says the police officers shot the duo and falsified a statement that the incident involved a shootout to repulse robbers.  IPOA states: “Mbai and Nduku were shot dead at Mlolongo Township, Machakos County. They were shot by police officers who thereafter reported that they were responding to a planned robbery.” “Upon an independent review of IPOA findings, the ODPP wrote to the Authority and gave the green light to charge the following officers with murder.”  It further states that Mr Leliman is also a suspect in the murder case of human rights lawyer Willie Kimani, his client and a taxi driver. The two officers also “face an additional charge of unlawful use of firearm contrary to Section 26 A (1) (a) of the Firearms Act.” Implicated in the third case are Constable Bernard Gachau and Sergeant James Mulwa who are facing murder and neglect of duty charges respectively. The duo is accused in the death of Ali Sora Bonaya, who collapsed and died at his home in Marsabit County after suffering injuries inflicted by police officers who clobbered him. In the statement signed by IPOA Chairperson Anne Makori, the body has promised commitment to address the plight of officers but has called on them to avoid using excessive force. President Uhuru Kenyatta recently warned police officers against brutalising Kenyans when enforcing the curfew. This came after deaths stemming from police brutality were noted in Homa Bay, Nairobi and Mombasa counties.         googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('div-gpt-ad-1584621281588-0'); }); Do not miss out on the latest news.

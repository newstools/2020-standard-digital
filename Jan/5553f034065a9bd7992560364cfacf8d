She doesn’t want to hold my hand in public             Chris Hart  26th Jan 2020 18:13:27 GMT +0300 Chris Hart  26th Jan 2020 18:13:27 GMT +0300 Chris Hart     googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('div-gpt-ad-1498022554617-0'); }); Hi Chris!  Can you settle an argument between me and my girlfriend? Whenever we’re out and about, I like to touch her. Nothing tasteless you understand. Just being close and affectionate. But she really objects! It feels so natural to me to want to sit close and touch someone I love, but she makes it very clear that she doesn’t want that sort of attention in public. I truly believe that she loves me, but we obviously disagree on this point.  Who’s right?  SEE ALSO :Are older women opting to live away from their partners?

When my husband and I were courting, we spent all our free time together. It was what we enjoyed the most, so we’d cancel anything else just to be together. We talked every day and constantly phoned one another. And when we were together, we gave each other our undivided attention.  But now we’re married we completely ignore each other even if we’re in the same room! And most days we’re not together all that much anyway. What with work, playing golf, aerobics, having a drink with friends...      Is this normal? It doesn’t feel right to me, and somehow I feel it will lead to trouble sooner of later.
